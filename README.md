# jupyter-dijets

This is a Jupyter notebook created by undergraduate student Leonie Hermann (Freiburg U., Erasmus at Lund University) that visualizes dijet data from the ATLAS high-mass dijet search (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09127) published on HEPData (www.hepdata.net).

It requires a Jupyter installation/server (jupyter.org), together with Pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org) and Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org). For any questions, please contact me.
